Limitations of JDBC:

Boilerplate Code: JDBC requires a lot of boilerplate code for tasks such as opening connections, preparing statements, executing queries, and closing connections. This can lead to verbose and repetitive code.

Exception Handling: JDBC throws checked exceptions, which need to be handled explicitly, leading to cluttered code with try-catch blocks.

Manual Resource Management: Developers need to explicitly close resources like connections, statements, and result sets, which can lead to resource leaks if not handled properly.

Complexity in Object Mapping: Mapping database tables to Java objects (and vice versa) needs to be done manually. This can become complex and error-prone, especially for large databases.

Lack of Caching: JDBC does not provide any caching mechanism, leading to potential performance issues in applications with frequent database access.

Transaction Management: Managing transactions in JDBC is cumbersome and requires explicit handling of commit and rollback operations.

Vendor Dependency: JDBC code can be highly dependent on specific database vendors, leading to portability issues if you need to switch databases.

Need for Hibernate:

Simplified Data Access: Hibernate simplifies data access by providing an abstraction layer over JDBC, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.

Automatic Object Mapping: Hibernate automatically maps Java objects to database tables and vice versa, reducing the complexity and potential for errors in manual mapping.

HQL (Hibernate Query Language): Hibernate provides HQL, which is more object-oriented and easier to use compared to SQL. HQL queries are database-independent.

Caching: Hibernate supports different levels of caching (first-level and second-level), which can significantly improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of database hits.

Transaction Management: Hibernate provides built-in transaction management, making it easier to manage transactions without dealing with JDBCâ€™s explicit commit and rollback operations.

Lazy Loading: Hibernate supports lazy loading, which means that associated data is not loaded from the database until it is actually accessed. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary data retrieval.

Portability: Hibernate abstracts the underlying database, making it easier to switch between different databases without significant code changes.

Criteria API: Hibernate provides a Criteria API, allowing developers to build queries programmatically, which can be useful for dynamic query generation.

Integration with Java EE and Spring: Hibernate integrates well with Java EE and Spring frameworks, providing a comprehensive solution for enterprise application development.

Advanced Features: Hibernate offers advanced features like cascading operations, inheritance mapping, and custom types, which are not readily available in plain JDBC.

In summary, while JDBC provides a low-level API for database interaction, Hibernate offers a higher-level abstraction that simplifies data access, enhances productivity, and provides advanced features for efficient and maintainable database management in Java applications.
